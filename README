NAME
    File::Truncate::Undoable - Truncate a file, with undo support

VERSION
    version 0.01

SEE ALSO
    Rinci::Transaction

DESCRIPTION
    This module has Rinci metadata.

FUNCTIONS
    None are exported by default, but they are exportable.

  truncate(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]
    Truncate a file, with undo support.

    On do, will trash file then create an empty file (with the same
    permission and ownership as the original). On undo, will trash the new
    file and untrash the old file.

    Note: chown will not be done if we are not running as root. Symlink is
    currently not permitted.

    Fixed state: file exists and size is not zero.

    Fixable state: file exists and size is not zero.

    Unfixable state: file does not exist or path is not a regular file
    (directory and symlink included).

    This function is idempotent (repeated invocations with same arguments
    has the same effect as single invocation). This function supports
    transactions.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   path* => *str*

    Special arguments:

    *   -tx_action => *str*

    Return value:

    Returns an enveloped result (an array). First element (status) is an
    integer containing HTTP status code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx
    function error). Second element (msg) is a string containing error
    message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third element (result) is optional,
    the actual result. Fourth element (meta) is called result metadata and
    is optional, a hash that contains extra information.
